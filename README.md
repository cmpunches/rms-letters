# rms-letters
 
A simple website that shows information about both RMS letters

## How it works

`rms-letters` downloads the page content of both letters and uses `cheerio` to get the amount of people who signed them.

## Installation

1. Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already
2. Clone/download this repository
3. Install all dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the server: `node index.js`
